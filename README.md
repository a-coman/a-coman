## Hi there! 👋

I'm Andrei, an Industrial Engineer who likes solving problems and building cool things that help people.

- 🔎 I'm currently a researcher at the [Atenea research group](https://atenea.lcc.uma.es/), where I'm exploring AI and Model-Based Software Engineering.

- 🛠️ I worked with: Java, Python, C#, C/C++, REST APIs, Linux, Git, and tools like UML (USE), Arduino and the Atlassian Suite.

- 🎮 I enjoy software engineering, AI and video games.

🐾 Thanks for stopping by :)
