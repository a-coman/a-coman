## Hi there! 👋

I'm Andrei, an incoming master's student in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Málaga. 

- 🔭 I'm currently a researcher at the Atenea research group, where I'm exploring AI and Model-Based Software Engineering.

- 🛠️ I worked with: C#, C/C++, Python, Java, REST APIs, Linux, Git, and tools like UML (USE), Arduino and the Atlassian Suite.

- 🎮 I love solving problems, building things that help people, and geeking out over software architecture and video games.

🐾 Thanks for stopping by :)
